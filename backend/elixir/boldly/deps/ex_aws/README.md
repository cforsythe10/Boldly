A flexible easy to use set of AWS APIs.

Available Services: https://github.com/ex-aws?q=service&type=&language=

## Getting Started

ExAws v2.0 breaks out every service into its own package. To use the S3 service, you need both the core `:ex_aws` package as well as the `:ex_aws_s3` package.

As with all ExAws services, you'll need a compatible HTTP client (defaults to `:hackney`) and whatever JSON or XML codecs needed by the services you want to use. Consult individual service documentation for details on what each service needs.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.1"},
    {:ex_aws_s3, "~> 2.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
    {:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6"},
  ]
end
```

With these deps you can use `ExAws` precisely as you're used to:

```
# make a request (with the default region)
ExAws.S3.list_objects("my-bucket") |> ExAws.request()

# or specify the region
ExAws.S3.list_objects("my-bucket") |> ExAws.request(region: "us-west-1")

# some operations support streaming
ExAws.S3.list_objects("my-bucket") |> ExAws.stream!() |> Enum.to_list()
```

### AWS Key configuration

ExAws requires valid AWS keys in order to work properly. ExAws by default does the equivalent of:

```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, :instance_role]
```

This means it will try to resolve credentials in order
* Look for the AWS standard `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables
* Resolve credentials with IAM
  * If running inside ECS and a [task role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) has been assigned it will use it
  * Otherwise it will fall back to the [instance role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)

AWS CLI config files are supported, but require an additional dependency:

```elixir
{:configparser_ex, "~> 2.0"}
```

You can then add `{:awscli, "profile_name", timeout}` to the above config and it
will pull information from `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`
```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  access_key_id: [{:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"}, {:awscli, "default", 30}, :instance_role],
  secret_access_key: [{:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}, {:awscli, "default", 30}, :instance_role]
```

For role based authentication via `role_arn` and `source_profile` an additional dependency is required:

```elixir
{:ex_aws_sts, "~> 2.0"}
```

Further information on role based authentication is provided in said dependency.

### Hackney configuration

ExAws by default uses [hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) to make HTTP requests to AWS API. You can modify the options as such:

```elixir
config :ex_aws, :hackney_opts,
  follow_redirect: true,
  recv_timeout: 30_000
```

### AWS Region Configuration.

You can set the region used by default for requests.

```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  region: "us-west-2",
```
Alternatively, the region can be set in an environment variable:

```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  region: {:system, "AWS_REGION"}
```

### JSON Codec Configuration

The default JSON codec is Poison.  You can choose a different one:

```elixir
config :ex_aws,
  json_codec: Jason
```


## Direct Usage

ExAws can also be used directly without any specific service module.

You need to figure out how the API of the specific AWS service works, in particular:
- Protocol (JSON or query).
- Path (depends on the service and the specific operation, usually "/").
- Service name (used to generate the request signature, [as described here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-string-to-sign.html)).
- Request body, query params, HTTP method, and headers (depends on the service and specific operation).

You can look for this information in the service's API reference at [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) or, for example, in the Go SDK API models at [github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis) (look for a `api-*.json` file).

The protocol dictates which operation module to use for the request. If the protocol is JSON, use `ExAws.Operation.JSON`, if it's query, use `ExAws.Operation.Query`.

### Examples

#### Redshift DescribeClusters

```elixir
action = :describe_clusters
action_string = action |> Atom.to_string |> Macro.camelize

operation =
  %ExAws.Operation.Query{
    path: "/",
    params: %{"Action" => action_string},
    service: :redshift,
    action: action
  }
  
ExAws.request(operation)
```

#### ECS RunTask

```elixir
data = %{
  taskDefinition: "hello_world",
  launchType: "FARGATE",
  networkConfiguration: %{
    awsvpcConfiguration: %{
      subnets: ["subnet-1a2b3c4d", "subnet-4d3c2b1a"],
      securityGroups: ["sg-1a2b3c4d"],
      assignPublicIp: "ENABLED"
    }
  }
}

operation =
  %ExAws.Operation.JSON{
    http_method: :post,
    headers: [
      {"x-amz-target", "AmazonEC2ContainerServiceV20141113.RunTask"},
      {"content-type", "application/x-amz-json-1.1"}
    ],
    path: "/",
    data: data,
    service: :ecs
}

ExAws.request(operation)
```

## Highlighted Features
- Easy configuration.
- Minimal dependencies. Choose your favorite JSON codec and HTTP client.
- Elixir streams to automatically retrieve paginated resources.
- Elixir protocols allow easy customization of Dynamo encoding / decoding.
- `mix aws.kinesis.tail your-stream-name` task for easily watching the contents of a kinesis stream.
- Simple. ExAws aims to provide a clear and consistent elixir wrapping around AWS APIs, not abstract them away entirely. For every action in a given AWS API there is a corresponding function within the appropriate module. Higher level abstractions like the aforementioned streams are in addition to and not instead of basic API calls.

That's it!

## Retries

ExAws will retry failed AWS API requests using exponential backoff per the "Full
Jitter" formula described in
https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html

The algorithm uses three values, which are configurable:

```elixir
# default values shown below

config :ex_aws, :retries,
  max_attempts: 10,
  base_backoff_in_ms: 10,
  max_backoff_in_ms: 10_000
```

* `max_attempts` is the maximum number of possible attempts with backoffs in between each one
* `base_backoff_in_ms` corresponds to the `base` value described in the blog post
* `max_backoff_in_ms` corresponds to the `cap` value described in the blog post

## Testing

If you want to run `mix test`, you'll need to have a local `dynamodb` running on port 8000.  
See [Setting up DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html).

The redirect test will intentionally cause a warning to be issued.
